# dark

The Netflix show Dark is amazing, but with so many characters, it can get pretty
tough to make sense of what going. So I gathered all the data in order to turn
it into a website.

## Data

The `lib/data.json` file contains a list of characters with the following keys:
`name`, `world`, `time` and `slug`. The `slug` and `world` keys can be used to infer the picture
in the `./src/assets/pictures/{world}/{slug}` folder.
